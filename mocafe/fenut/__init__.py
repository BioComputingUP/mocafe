"""
``fenut`` stands for 'FEniCS Utils', so this subpackage contains a variety of utility classes and methods for
managing Phase Field Models simulations.

It is composed of the following modules:

* ``log``, which manages the creation of useful log files with the help of the ``logging`` Python module.
* ``mansimdata``, which contains methods to manage simulation data and generate simulation reports.
* ``parameters``, which contains classes and modules to manage simulation parameters.
* ``solvers``, which contains some useful default implementation of FeniCS solvers.
* ``fenut``, which contains general-purpose classes and methods.

You can find full documentation for each module in the "Submodules" section below.
