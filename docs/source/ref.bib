abstract = {Recently, mathematical modeling and simulation of diseases and their treatments have enabled the prediction of clinical outcomes and the design of optimal therapies on a personalized (i.e., patient-specific) basis. This new trend in medical research has been termed “predictive medicine.” Prostate cancer (PCa) is a ma- jor health problem and an ideal candidate to explore tissue-scale, personalized modeling of cancer growth for two main reasons: First, it is a small organ, and, second, tumor growth can be esti- mated by measuring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA, a PCa biomarker in blood), which may enable in vivo validation. In this paper, we present a simple continuous model that reproduces the growth patterns of PCa. We use the phase-field method to account for the transformation of healthy cells to cancer cells and use diffusion−reaction equations to compute nutrient consumption and PSA production. To accurately and efficiently compute tumor growth, our simulations leverage isogeometric analysis (IGA). Our model is shown to reproduce a known shape instability from a spheroidal pattern to fingered growth. Results of our computa- tions indicate that such shift is a tumor response to escape starva- tion, hypoxia, and, eventually, necrosis. Thus, branching enables the tumor to minimize the distance from inner cells to external nutrients, contributing to cancer survival and further develop- ment. We have also used our model to perform tissue-scale, per- sonalized simulation of a PCa patient, based on prostatic anatomy extracted from computed tomography images. This simulation shows tumor progression similar to that seen in clinical practice.},

Prima lettura

In questo articolo presentano un modello phase field per lo sviluppo del tumore alla prostata. La domanda che accompagna l'articolo {\`{e}} quindi: quanto {\`{e}} accurato il modello?

Risposta: il modello {\`{e}} molto accurato sia in vitro che in vivo. {\`{e}} stato confrontato sia con un cancro in vitro sia con lo sviluppo di un tumore in vitro inserendo il modello matematico in un modello 3D di una prostata di un paziente reale, dimostrando uno sviluppo del cancro molto simile.},

abstract = {Moving interface problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. To develop an accurate and efficient methodology for this class of problems, we present algorithms for local h-adaptivity of hierarchical B-splines to be utilized in isogeometric analysis. We extend B{\'{e}}zier projection, an efficient quadrature-free local projection technique, to the hierarchical setting. In this case, extraction operators may not be invertible. To address this issue we develop a multi-level reconstruction operator which maintains the locality properties of the projection. We also introduce a balance parameter to control the overlap of hierarchical functions leading to improved numerical conditioning. We apply our algorithms to the simulation of localized prostate cancer growth. We model this disease using the phase-field method and a set of diffusion–reaction equations to account for the dynamics of nutrients and a key biomarker termed Prostate Specific Antigen. Our results include examples on simple 2D and 3D domains and a more compelling tissue-scale, patient-specific simulation, which is run over a prostate anatomy extracted from medical images. Our methods for local h-adaptivity efficiently capture the evolving interface between the tumor and the neighboring healthy tissue with remarkable accuracy in all cases.},

abstract="Many real-world problems are governed by non-linear mathematical models. The drying of paint, the weather, or the mixing of fluids are just some examples of non-linear phenomenons. In fact, most of the physical, biological, and chemical processes going on around us everyday are described by more or less non-linear laws of nature. Thus, extensions of the finite element method to non-linear equations are of special interest. In this chapter we study the standard methods for tackling non-linear partial differential equations discretized with finite elements, namely, Newton's method and its simplified variant Piccard, or, fixed-point iteration.",

abstract = {Understanding tumor induced angiogenesis is a challenging problem with important consequences for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Recently, strong evidences suggest the dual role of endothelial cells on the migrating tips and on the proliferating body of blood vessels, in consonance with further events behind lumen formation and vascular patterning. In this paper we present a multi-scale phase-field model that combines the benefits of continuum physics description and the capability of tracking individual cells. The model allows us to discuss the role of the endothelial cells' chemotactic response and proliferation rate as key factors that tailor the neovascular network. Importantly, we also test the predictions of our theoretical model against relevant experimental approaches in mice that displayed distinctive vascular patterns. The model reproduces the in vivo patterns of newly formed vascular networks, providing quantitative and qualitative results for branch density and vessel diameter on the order of the ones measured experimentally in mouse retinas. Our results highlight the ability of mathematical models to suggest relevant hypotheses with respect to the role of different parameters in this process, hence underlining the necessary collaboration between mathematical modeling, in vivo imaging and molecular biology techniques to improve current diagnostic and therapeutic tools. {\textcopyright} 2011 Travasso et al.},

Features of UFL include support for variational forms and functionals, automatic differentiation of forms and expressions, arbitrary function space hierarchies for multifield problems, general differential operators and flexible tensor algebra. With these features, UFL has been used to effortlessly express finite element methods for complex systems of partial differential equations in near-mathematical notation, resulting in compact, intuitive and readable programs. We present in this work the language and its construction. An implementation of UFL is freely available as an open-source software library. The library generates abstract syntax tree representations of variational problems, which are used by other software libraries to generate concrete low-level implementations. Some application examples are presented and libraries that support UFL are highlighted.},
