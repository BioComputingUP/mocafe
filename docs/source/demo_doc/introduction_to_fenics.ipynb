        "\n\n# A brief introduction to FEniCS\nThis demo is ment to give a brief introduction to the FEniCS computing platform for the Mocafe users who\nnever came across this software. For a complete understanding of this demo it is required to have a basic\nunderstanding of partial differential equations (PDEs), finite element method (FEM), and Python scripting.\n\nThis demo is deliberately very brief, given the presence online of excellent and extensive tutorials. Just to\nmention a few, you can find for free the book `The FEniCS Tutorial <https://fenicsproject.org/tutorial/>`_\n:cite:`LangtangenLogg2017`, a collection of\n`documented demos <https://fenicsproject.org/olddocs/dolfin/1.3.0/python/demo/index.html>`_, and the `tutorial\ncreated by J. S. Dokken <https://jorgensd.github.io/dolfinx-tutorial/>`_ for the development version of FEniCS,\nFEniCSx. In case you feel the need of a more gradual introduction to FEniCS, we recommend you those websites.\n\n## What is FEniCS\n`FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_ :cite:`FENICS2015` is a popular open source computing platform for solving PDEs,\nmainly using the Finite Element Method. FEniCS provides high level Python and C++ interfaces together with access to\npowerful algebra backend, ensuring both efficiency and usability.\n\n## The basic FEniCS workflow\nEvery FEniCS script follows a general workflow to solve PDEs that is summarized in the following. See also the figure\nbelow for a brief summary\n\n0. **Initial setup**. The operations here depend on the problem you're solving but, in general, it is a good\n   practice to define some general variables at the beginning of the script. Also, this might be the good place\n   for setting up loggers, files to store data, and so on.\n1. **Mesh definition or import**. Before solving any PDE problem, you need to define the space where you want to\n   solve it. FEniCS has built-in methods to generate simple meshes, such as 2D rectangles or 3D cubes. However, it\n   is also possible (and often more interesting) to import any given mesh (e.g. a 3D model of a gear).\n2. **Definition of the spatial discretization**. Then, it is useful to define how you want your PDE to be discretized\n   in space choosing the type of Finite Element to use. This might be a critical choice for some problems.\n3. **Definition of initial and boundary conditions**.\n4. **Definition of the weak form**. One of the greatest things in FEniCS is the Unified Form language (UFL)\n   :cite:`UFL2014`, which makes the coding of the PDE weak form very close to the mathematical language.\n5. **Problem solution**. The actual solution of the PDE system. This might be an iteration in time, in case the PDE\n   system you're considering is time-dependent.\n\n<img src=\"file://./images/introduction_to_fenics/workflow.png\" width=\"600\">\n\nWe're going to see this very workflow in practice in the next section.\n\n## The diffusion (or *heat*) equation solved with FEniCS\nThe simplest time-variant PDE is the so-called *diffusion equation* (or *heat equation*) which is used both to describe\nthe diffusion of a chemical in a fluid (e.g. salt in water) and the evolution of heat distribution in a conductor.\n\nThe equation reads:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 u & \\quad \\textrm{in} \\; \\Omega \\\\\n\n    u(t=0) = u_0 & \\quad \\textrm{in} \\; \\Omega \\\\\n\n    \\nabla u \\cdot n = 0 & \\quad \\textrm{in} \\; \\Gamma \\\\\\end{align}\n\nWhere:\n\n- the first row is the actual PDE, which is defined on the entire spatial domain $\\Omega$;\n- the second row represents the initial condition (which will be discussed in detail below);\n- and the third row represents the boundary condition (set to natural Neumann), which is of course\n  defined on the boundary $\\Gamma$.\n\nSolving this problem in FEniCS requires just a few lines of Python code. Let's see the implementation in detail.\n\n### Initial setup\nIn this simple case we just import the FEniCS package and create an ``.xdmf`` file, which will used for storing the\nsolution of our problem in time. You can open this kind of file with the software\n`Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_, which is one of the recommended ways to visualize results obtained with FEniCS.\n\n"

        "### Weak form definition\nThe definition of the weak form of our PDE of interest is the starting point of the finite elment metod. Briefly,\nthe weak form is just a mathematical problem, derived from the original PDE, of which solution is an approximation\nof our PDE of interest in a given function space $V$.\n\nFor people experienced in weak form definition is very simple to derive the one for the diffusion equation.\nThe discretization of the PDE in time with backward Euler leads to the following semi-discrete equation:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{u - u_0}{dt} - D \\nabla^2 u = 0\\end{align}\n\nAnd the weak form of this problem can be written in the canonical form:\n\n\\begin{align}a(u, v) = L(v)\\end{align}\n\nWhere $a$ and $L$ are defined as:\n\n\\begin{align}a(u, v) & = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{u}{dt} \\cdot v \\cdot dx + \\int_{\\Omega} D \\cdot \\nabla u\n  \\cdot \\nabla v \\cdot dx \\\\\n  L(v) & = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{u_0}{dt} \\cdot v \\cdot dx \\\\\\end{align}\n\nIn the following, we translate this mathematical equation into scientific code leveraging one of the best feature of\nFEniCS: the Unified Form Language (UFL). Indeed, you can see yourself that the definition of a and L is very close\nto the actual mathematical formula.\n\n"
