        "\n# Prostate cancer phase field model\n\nIn this short demo we will show you how to simulate a phase field model described by G. Lorenzo and collaborators\nin 2016 :cite:`Lorenzo2016` using FEniCS and mocafe. The model was published on PNAS in 2016 and presents a\ncontinuous mathematical model able to reproduce the growth pattern of prostate cancer at tissue scale.\n\n## How to run this example on mocafe\nMake sure you have FEniCS and mocafe installed and download the source script of this page (see above for the link).\nThen, simply run it using python:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    python3 prostate_cancer2d.py\n\nHowever, it is recommended to exploit parallelization to save simulation time:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    mpirun -n 4 python3 prostate_cancer2d.py\n\nNotice that the number following the ``-n`` option is the number of MPI processes you using for parallelizing the\nsimulation. You can change it accordingly with your CPU.\n\n## Brief introduction to the mathematical model\nThe model is composed of just two partial differential equations (PDEs). The first describes the evolution of the\ncancer phase field  $\\varphi$, and reads:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = \\lambda \\nabla^2 \\varphi - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\frac{dF(\\varphi)}{d\\varphi}\n    + \\chi \\sigma - A \\varphi\\end{align}\n\nThe second describes the variation of nutrients concentration $\\sigma$ in time:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t} = \\epsilon \\nabla^2\\sigma + s - \\delta\\cdot\\varphi - \\gamma\\cdot\\sigma\\end{align}\n\nA complete discussion of these two equations is above the purpose of this short demo so, if you're interested, we\nsuggest you to refer to the original paper :cite:`Lorenzo2016`. However, we just mention some of their main features.\n\nThe first equation describes a cancer development driven by both proliferation, and apoptosis. Cancer cells are\nassumed to duplicate in presence of nutrient and their proliferation is, indeed, described by the term\n$\\chi \\sigma$, which contains the nutrients concentration. Apoptosis is, instead assumed to occur at a constant\nrate and is represented in the equation by the term $-A \\varphi$.\n\nThe second equation describes the diffusion of the nutrients with the Fick's low of diffusion\n:cite:`enwiki:1058693490`. The equation assumes that the nutrient is supplied constantly in the domain with\na distribution $s$, and that the nutrient is consumed at a constant rate by the cancer cells (term\n$-\\delta\\varphi$). Additionaly, the nutrient is supposed to decay at a constant rate, described by the term\n$\\gamma \\sigma$.\n\n\n"

        "However, if you know what a weak form is and how to define it for a PDEs set, you migth appreciate how easy it is\nto define them in FEniCS using the Unified Form Language (UFL). Just to give you a taste, we show you how the system\nlooks like in code:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  v1, v2 = fenics.TestFunctions(function_space)\n  prostate_cancer_weak_form = (((phi - phi_prec) / parameters.get_value(\"dt\")) * v * fenics.dx) \\\n    + (parameters.get_value(\"lambda\") * fenics.dot(fenics.grad(phi), fenics.grad(v)) * fenics.dx) \\\n    + ((1 / parameters.get_value(\"tau\")) * df_dphi(phi, parameters.get_value(\"chempot_constant\")) * v * fenics.dx) \\\n    + (- parameters.get_value(\"chi\") * sigma * v * fenics.dx) \\\n    + (parameters.get_value(\"A\") * phi * v * fenics.dx)\n  nutrient_weak_form = (((sigma - sigma_old) / parameters.get_value(\"dt\")) * v * fenics.dx) \\\n    + (parameters.get_value(\"epsilon\") * fenics.dot(fenics.grad(sigma), fenics.grad(v)) * fenics.dx) \\\n    + (- s * v * fenics.dx) \\\n    + (parameters.get_value(\"delta\") * phi * v * fenics.dx) \\\n    + (parameters.get_value(\"gamma\") * sigma * v * fenics.dx)\n  weak_form = prostate_cancer_weak_form + nutrient_weak_form\n\nEven knowing nothing about FEM, you might notice how close this code is to actual mathematical language. This is not\njust eye-pleasing, but it makes it way easier to define the system and to introduce variations to study the model\nfrom different perspectives.\nFrom this code, FEniCS is able to efficiently construct all the data structures needed to get our\nsolution at each time step.

        "Let's analyze everything step-by-step. First, we update the simulation time:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  # update time\n  t += parameters.get_value(\"dt\")\n\nThen, we define the \"problem\" we want to be solved by the SNES solver:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  # define problem\n  problem = SNESProblem(weak_form, u, [])\n\n  # set up algebraic system for SNES\n  b = fenics.PETScVector()\n  J_mat = fenics.PETScMatrix()\n  snes_solver.setFunction(problem.F, b.vec())\n  snes_solver.setJacobian(problem.J, J_mat.mat())\n\nThe few lines above might look a bit obscure if you're not experienced with FEM and numerical methods in general,\nbut we will do our best to clarify a bit.\n\nLike every numerical method, FEM translates a system of PDEs in an algebraic system of linear equations of which\nthe solution is an estimate of the real PDE system solution. The job of the class ``PETScProblem`` is exactly to\nconstruct the algebraic system of equations from the weak form, the function we want to find, and the boundary\nconditions. For our example:\n\n- we already defined the weak form above, so we can use it as it is;\n- the function we want to find is ``u``, which contains both ``phi`` and ``sigma``;\n- we left the list of boundary conditions empty (``[]``) because we are considering natural Neumann boundary\n  conditions, which are applied by default by the FEM method.\n\nOnce we did that, we simply need to tell SNES to solve our system, specifying the weak form (``problem.F``) and\nits jacobian matrix (``problem.J``) as a ``PETScVector`` and a ``PETScMatrix``, respectively. This is indeed what\nwe're doing with the methods ``setFunction`` and ``setJacobian``.\n\nThen, we can solve our system placing the result in the ``u`` function:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  # solve system\n  snes_solver.solve(None, u.vector().vec())\n\nAssign the result at the current step as the new values of ``phi0`` and ``sigma0``, in order to be the initial\ncondition for the next iteration:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  fenics.assign([phi0, sigma0], u)\n\nAnd finally, we write the result on the ``.xdmf`` files and update the progress bar:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  # save current solutions to file\n  phi_xdmf.write(phi0, t)  # write the value of phi at time t\n  sigma_xdmf.write(sigma0, t)  # write the value of sigma at time t\n\n  # update progress bar\n  if rank == 0:\n      progress_bar.update(1)\n\n\n"
