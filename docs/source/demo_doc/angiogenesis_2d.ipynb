        "\n# Angiogenesis phase field model\nIn this demo we will reproduce the angiogenesis phase field model described by Travasso et al. in 2011\n:cite:`Travasso2011a`. In this implementation, we will simulate a set of discrete cells expressing a generic angiogenic\nfactor (e.g. VEGF), which lead to the sprouting of a 2D vascular network. In the following, we will refer to this cells\nas *source cells*, since are the only source of angiogenic factor in this model.\n\n## How to run this example on mocafe\nMake sure you have FEniCS and mocafe installed and download the source script of this page (see above for the link).\n\nThen, download the parameters file for the simulation from\n:download:`this link<./demo_in/angiogenesis_2d/parameters.ods>` and place it inside the folder\n``demo_in/angiogenesis_2d``:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    mkdir demo_in\n    mkdir demo_in/angiogenesis_2d\n    mv parameters.ods demo_in/angiogenesis_2d/\n\nThen, simply run it using python:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    python3 angiogenesis_2d.py\n\nIf you are in a hurry, you can exploit parallelization to run the simulation faster:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    mpirun -n 4 python3 angiogenesis_2d.py\n\nNotice that the number following the ``-n`` option is the number of MPI processes you using for parallelizing the\nsimulation. You can change it accordingly with your CPU.\n\n\n## Brief introduction to the mathematical model\nThe model is composed of two main parts interacting together: a set of differential equation and a computational\n\"agent-based\" model. The first part takes into account the continuous dynamics of the angiogenic factor and\nof the capillaries field, while the latter is responsible for the discrete dynamics of the source cells (i.e. the\ncells expressing a generic angiogenic factor, such as VEGF) and of the tip cells (i.e. the cells of endothelial\norigin which lead the sprouting of the new vessels). A complete discussion of this model is above the purpose of this\ndemo so, if you're interested, we suggest you to refer to the original paper :cite:`Travasso2011a`.\nHowever, in the following we provide you a short introduction for your convenience.\n\n### Differential equations\nThe mathematical part is just composed of two partial differential equations (PDEs). The first PDE is for the\nangiogenic factor ($af$) and takes into account: a. its diffusion; b. its consumption by the endothelial\ncapillary cells (the field c). The equation reads:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial af}{\\partial t} = \\nabla (D_{af} \\cdot \\nabla af) - \\alpha_T \\cdot c \\cdot af \\cdot \\Theta(c)\\end{align}\n\nWhere the first part of the right-hand term comes from the Fick's low of diffusion :cite:`enwiki:1058693490`, while\nthe second term is a decrease driven by the c field.\n\nThe second PDE describes the dynamics of the capillaries, which are represented by a field $c$ of extreme\nvalues -1 and +1, where high values represent a part of the domain where the capillary is present, while the low values\nrepresent the parts of the domain where the capillaries are not present. The equation reads:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = M_c \\nabla^2 \\cdot [-c + c^3 - \\epsilon \\nabla^2 c] + \\alpha_p(af)c\\Theta(c)\\end{align}\n\nAgain, we have two terms composing the right-hand side of the equation: the first term is a Cahn-Hillard term, which\nis responsible for the interface dynamics of the field; the second just represents the proliferation of endothelial\ncells, which is driven by the angiogenic factor $af$. This dependence, however, is not linear: the proliferation\nrate $alpha_p(af)$ grows linearly with af only up to a certain value of $af$, limiting the growth of\nendothelial cells:\n\n\\begin{align}\\alpha_p(af) = \\alpha_p \\cdot af_p & \\quad \\textrm{if} \\quad af>af_p \\\\\n                = \\alpha_p \\cdot af  & \\quad \\textrm{if} \\quad 0<af \\le af_p \\\\\n                = 0 & \\quad \\textrm{if} \\quad af \\le 0\\end{align}\n\nAlso notice that the last PDE is of total degree 4, which makes the equation not solvable using the finite element\nmethod (FEM) with standard first-degree elements. For this reason, as we will show below, in this implementation\nthe equation is actually splitted into two equations of degree 2, introducing an auxilliary variable $\\mu$:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} - \\nabla \\cdot M \\nabla\\mu  - \\alpha_p(af)c\\Theta(c) &= 0 \\quad\n   \\textrm{in} \\quad \\Omega\n\n   \\mu - [-c + c^3 - \\epsilon \\nabla^2 c] &= 0 \\quad \\textrm{in} \\quad \\Omega.\\end{align}\n\n### Computational \"agent-based\" model\nIn this implementation only two discrete cell populations are considered: the source cells and the tip cells.\n\nThe source cells are the cells expressing the angiogenic factor. They represent hypoxic cells starving for nutrients\nand thus inducing the angiogenesis to survive. In practice, these are implemented as simple circles, relatively far\nfrom the original vessel, where the angiogenic factor concentration is constantly equal to $af_s$ (which is 1\nin the present implementation). Moreover, to simulate the dependency of the hypoxic signalling on the local oxygen\nconcentration, the source cells stop expressing the angiogenic factor when the capillaries are sufficiently near.\n\nThe tip cells have a more complex behaviour, since at each time step of the simulation they can activate,\ndeactivate, and move in the spatial domain. The activation of a tip cell can occur only inside an existent capillary,\nand it happens only if $af$ and the norm of its gradient $|\\nabla af|$, are above the thresholds\n$af_c$ and $G_m$, respectively. Moreover, only points distant more than 4 times the radius of another\ntip cell can become a new tip cell. This limit was introduced to consider the self-inhibition in the tip cells\nactivation caused by the Notch pathway. In case more than one point respect all these conditions at the same time\nstep, one of them is selected randomly and only that point will be used to create a new tip cell. Thus, at each time\nstep, no more than one new tip cell can activate.\n\nOnce a tip cell is active, it moves inside the domain following the gradient of the angiogenic factor. The velocity\nvector is indeed computed as follows:\n\n\\begin{align}v & = \\chi \\nabla af & \\quad \\textrm{if} \\quad |\\nabla af|<G_M \\\\\n    \\; & = \\chi \\frac{\\nabla af}{|\\nabla af|}G_M & \\quad \\textrm{if} \\quad |\\nabla af| \\ge G_M\\end{align}\n\nNotice that the velocity cannot be higher in norm than $G_M$. Once a tip cell moved, the capilllaries\nphase field $c$ is updated, adding a circle in the position of the tip cell with a constant value:\n\n\\begin{align}c_c = \\frac{\\alpha_p(af)\\pi R_c}{2 \\|v\\|}\\end{align}\n\nWhere $R_c$ is the radius of the tip cell.\nNotice that this is one of the key elements of the model, because it merges the continuous dynamics of the field\n$c$ with the discrete dynamics of the tip cells.\n\nFinally, the tip cells deactivate when :math`af` or the norm of its gradient drop below the above-mentioned thresholds\nvalues.\n\n"

        "Notice that additionally to the system solution a number of operations are performed at each time stem which require\na bit of clarification. Let's see the code step by step then.\n\nThe first thing we did just after the time update is removing the sources near the vessels, calling:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  sources_manager.remove_sources_near_vessels(c_0)\n\nWith this single line, we are asking the sources manager to check the field ``c_0``, which represent the vessels,\nand to remove all the source cells the center of which is closer than the distance $d$. Notice that we don't\npass the distance as argument of the method because it's already contained in the parameters file we passed to the\nobject constructor, but we could also pass it in the method through the 'd' key:\n``sources_manager.remove_sources_near_vessels(c_0, d=given_value)``\n\nThe second thing we did is to handle the tip cells using the three statements:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  # activate tip cell\n  tip_cell_manager.activate_tip_cell(c_0, af_0, grad_af, step)\n\n  # revert tip cells\n  tip_cell_manager.revert_tip_cells(af_0, grad_af)\n\n  # move tip cells\n  tip_cell_manager.move_tip_cells(c_0, af_0, grad_af)\n\nWhich respectively activate, deactivate and move the tip cells according to the algorithm we briefly discussed\nin the section `Brief introduction to the mathematical model<angiogenesis_2d_brief_introduction>` and that\nis extensively explained in the original paper :cite`Travasso2011a`. Notice that, similarly to the methods before,\nall the default threshold values do not need to be passed in the methods because they are already defined in the\nparameters file. Also notice that, in case there are no active tip cells in the current time step,\nthe second and the third statement have no effect.\n\nThen, we save the current tip cells in the above-defined tip cells field for visualizing them, using the method\n``get_latest_tip_cell_function()``:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  tipcells_field.assign(tip_cell_manager.get_latest_tip_cell_function())\n\nAfter having took care of all these things, we simply solve the PDE model and assign the computed values of the\nsolution to the ``c_0``, ``mu_0`` and ``af_0`` fields, in order to have them as initial condition for the next\nstep:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  fenics.solve(weak_form == 0, u, J=jacobian)\n\n  # assign u to the initial conditions functions\n  fenics.assign([af_0, c_0, mu_0], u)\n\nFinally, we apply the remaining sources to the new ``af_0`` function:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  # update source field\n  sources_manager.apply_sources(af_0)\n\nwe compute the new value for the gradient of ``af``:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  grad_af.assign(fenics.project(fenics.grad(af_0), grad_af_function_space))\n\nwe write everything on the ``.xdmf files``:\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  # save data\n  file_af.write(af_0, t)\n  file_c.write(c_0, t)\n  tipcells_xdmf.write(tipcells_field, t)\n\nand we update the progress bar, in order to inform the user on the progress of the simulation.\n\n.. code-block:: default\n\n  if rank == 0:\n    pbar.update(1)\n\n"
