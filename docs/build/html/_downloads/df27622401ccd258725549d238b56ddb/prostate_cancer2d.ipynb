        "\n# Prostate cancer phase field model\n\nIn this short demo we will show you how to simulate a phase field model described by G. Lorenzo and collaborators\nin 2016 :cite:`Lorenzo2016` using FEniCS and mocafe. The model was published on PNAS in 2016 and presents a\ncontinuous mathematical model able to reproduce the growth pattern of prostate cancer at tissue scale.\n\n## How to run this example on mocafe\nMake sure you have FEniCS and mocafe installed and download the source script of this page (see above for the link).\nThen, simply run it using python:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    python3 prostate_cancer2d.py\n\nIf you are in a hurry, you can exploit parallelization to run the simulation faster:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    mpirun -n 4 python3 prostate_cancer2d.py\n\nNotice that the number following the ``-n`` option is the number of MPI processes you using for parallelizing the\nsimulation. You can change it accordingly with your CPU.\n\n## Brief introduction to the mathematical model\nThe model is composed of just two partial differential equations (PDEs). The first describes the evolution of the\ncancer phase field  $\\varphi$, and reads:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = \\lambda \\nabla^2 \\varphi - \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\frac{dF(\\varphi)}{d\\varphi}\n    + \\chi \\sigma - A \\varphi\\end{align}\n\nThe second describes the variation of nutrients concentration $\\sigma$ in time:\n\n\\begin{align}\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial t} = \\epsilon \\nabla^2\\sigma + s - \\delta\\cdot\\varphi - \\gamma\\cdot\\sigma\\end{align}\n\nA complete discussion of these two equations is above the purpose of this short demo so, if you're interested, we\nsuggest you to refer to the original paper :cite:`Lorenzo2016`. However, we just mention some of their main features.\n\nThe first equation describes a cancer development driven by both proliferation, and apoptosis. Cancer cells are\nassumed to duplicate in presence of nutrient and their proliferation is, indeed, described by the term\n$\\chi \\sigma$, which contains the nutrients concentration. Apoptosis is, instead assumed to occurr at a constant\nrate and is represented in the equation by the term $-A \\varphi$.\n\nThe second equation describes the diffusion of the nutrients with the Fick's low of diffusion\n:cite:`enwiki:1058693490`. The equation assumes that the nutrient is supplied constantly in the domain with\na distribution $s$, and that the nutrient is consumed at a constant rate by the cancer cells (term\n$-\\delta\\varphi$). Additionaly, the nutrient is supposed to decay at a constant rate, described by the term\n$\\gamma \\sigma$.\n\n\n"

        "The few lines above might look a bit obscure if you're not experienced with FEM and numerical methods in general,\nbut we will do our best to clarify a bit.\n\nLike every numerical method, FEM translates a system of PDEs in an algebraic system of linear equations of which\nthe solution is an estimate of the real PDE system solution. FEniCS delegates the construction and the solution of\nthis system to `PETSc <https://petsc.org/release/>`_ (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation),\nits default algebraic backend.\n\nThe job of the class ``PETScProblem`` is to construct the algebraic system of equations from the weak form,\nits jacobian matrix, and the boundary conditions. For our example:\n\n- we already defined the weak form above, so we can use it as it is;\n- we can retrieve the Jacobian matrix, which is a multidimensional version of the traditional matematical derivative,\n  symply calling the FEniCS command ``derivative``;\n- we left the list of boundary conditions empty (``[]``) because we are considering natural Neumann boundary\n  conditions, which are applied by default by the FEM method.\n\nThe job of the class ``PETScNewtonSolver``, instead, is to define the algorithm to be used to solve the 'problem'\ndefined above, and to apply it for the computation of the actual solution. The algorithm may be one of the many\navailable for solving algebraic systems of equations. The reason of the name 'Newton Solver` is just because\nthe system of PDEs we are solving is non-linear and thus it requires this class of solvers. More precisely, in this\nimplementation we are asking to PETSc to solve our system with a Krylov solver of type 'gmres'\n(``\"ksp_type\": \"gmres\"``) using a preconditioner called \"asm\" (``\"pc_type\": \"asm\"``). For further details, you\nare suggested to have a look to chapter 9 of the book \"The Finite Element Method: Theory, Implementation,\nand Applications\", by Larson and Bengzon :cite:`Larson2013`\n\n"
