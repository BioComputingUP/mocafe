Welcome to *mocafe*'s documentation!
====================================
*mocafe* is a Python package based on `FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/>`_ :cite:`FENICS2015` to develop and simulate
Phase Field mathematical models for cancer.

The purpose of *mocafe* is to provide an open source and efficient implementation of legacy Phase Field mathematical
models of cancer development and angiogenesis. You can use *mocafe* to:

* reproduce legacy cancer phase field model (also in parallel with `MPI`);
* understand them better inspecting the code, and changing the parameters;
* integrate these models in yours FEniCS scripts.
