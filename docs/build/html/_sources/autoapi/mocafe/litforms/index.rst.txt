:py:mod:`mocafe.litforms`
=========================

.. py:module:: mocafe.litforms

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This subpackage contains some Phase-Field models presented in the scientific literature. Each model is implemented as
   a module. Each module contains a list of functions, each returning a PDE of the model coded in UFL.

   Now the models implemented are:

   * ``prostate_cancer``, which implements a Phase Field prostate cancer model described by
     Lorenzo and collaborators :cite:`Lorenzo2016`.
   * ``xu2016``, which implements a Phase Field cancer model described by
     Xu and collaborators :cite:`Xu2016`.

   You can find full documentation for each module in the "Submodules" section below.
