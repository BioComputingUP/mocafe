Prostate cancer phase field model
==================================

In this short demo we will show you how to simulate a phase field model described by G. Lorenzo and collaborators
in 2016 :cite:`Lorenzo2016` using FEniCS and mocafe. The model was published on PNAS in 2016 and presents a
continuous mathematical model able to reproduce the growth pattern of prostate cancer at tissue scale.

How to run this example on mocafe
---------------------------------
Make sure you have FEniCS and mocafe and download the source script of this page (see above for the link).
Then, simply run it using python:

    python3 prostate_cancer2d.py

If you are in a hurry, you can exploit parallelization to run the simulation faster:

    mpirun -n 4 python3 prostate_cancer2d.py

Notice that the number following the ``-n`` option is the number of MPI processes you using for parallelizing the
simulation. You can change it accordingly with your CPU.

Brief introduction to the mathematical model
--------------------------------------------
The model is composed of just two partial differential equations (PDEs). The first describes the evolution of the
cancer phase field  :math:`\varphi`, and reads:

.. math::
    \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial t} = \lambda \nabla^2 \varphi - \frac{1}{\tau}\frac{dF(\varphi)}{d\varphi}
    + \chi \sigma - A \varphi

The second describes the variation of nutrients concentration :math:`\sigma` in time:

.. math::
    \frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial t} = \epsilon \nabla^2\sigma + s - \delta\cdot\varphi - \gamma\cdot\sigma

A complete discussion of these two equations is above the purpose of this short demo so, if you're interested, we
suggest you to refer to the original paper :cite:`Lorenzo2016`. However, we just mention some of their main features.

The first equation describes a cancer development driven by both proliferation, and apoptosis. Cancer cells are
assumed to duplicate in presence of nutrient and their proliferation is, indeed, described by the term
:math:`\chi \sigma`, which contains the nutrients concentration. Apoptosis is, instead assumed to occurr at a constant
rate and is rpresented in the equation by the term :math:`-A \varphi`.

The second equation describes the diffusion of the nutrients with the Fick's low of diffusion
:cite:`enwiki:1058693490`. The equation assumes that the nutrient is supplied constantly in the domain with
a distribution :math:`s`, and that the nutrient is consumed at a constant rate by the cancer cells (term
:math:`-\delta\varphi`). Additionaly, the nutrient is supposed to decay at a constant rate, described by the term
:math:`\gamma \sigma`.

Implementation
------------------------------------------

Setup
^^^^^
After the math, let's see the code. To reproduce this model we need first to import everything we need throughout
the simulation. Notice that while most of the packages are provided by mocafe, we also use some other stuff.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-77

.. code-block:: default

    import sys
    import numpy as np
    import fenics
    import random
    from tqdm import tqdm
    from pathlib import Path
    file_folder = Path(__file__).parent.resolve()
    mocafe_folder = file_folder.parent
    sys.path.append(str(mocafe_folder))  # appending mocafe path. Must be removed
    from mocafe.fenut.solvers import PETScProblem, PETScSolver
    from mocafe.fenut.fenut import get_mixed_function_space, setup_xdmf_files
    from mocafe.fenut.mansimdata import setup_data_folder
    from mocafe.expressions import EllipseField, PythonFunctionField
    from mocafe.fenut.parameters import from_dict
    import mocafe.litforms.prostate_cancer as pc_model


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 78-82

Then, it is useful (even though not necessary) to do a number of operations before running our simulation.

First of all, we shut down the logging messages from FEniCS, leaving only the error messages in case something goes
*really* wrong. If you want to check out the FEniCS messages, you can comment this line.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-84

.. code-block:: default

    fenics.set_log_level(fenics.LogLevel.ERROR)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 85-87

Then, we define the MPI rank for each process. Generally speaking, this is necessary for running the simulation in
parallel using ``mpirun``, even though in this simulation is not largely used, as we are going to see.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 87-90

.. code-block:: default

    comm = fenics.MPI.comm_world
    rank = comm.Get_rank()


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-103

Then, we can define the files where to save our result for visualization and post-processing. The suggested format
for saving FEniCS simulations is using ``.xdmf`` files, which can easily be visualized in
`Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.

Even though FEniCS provides its own classes and method to define these files, in the following we use two mocafe
methods for defining:

- first, the folder where to save the result of the simulation. In this case, the folder will be based inside
  the current folder (``base_location``) and it's called demo_out/prostate_cancer2d;
- then, the two files for the cancer :math:`\varphi` and for the nutrients :math:`\sigma`, which will be called
  ``phi.xdmf`` and ``sigma.xdmf``.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-109

.. code-block:: default

    data_folder = setup_data_folder(sim_name=str(__file__).replace(".py", ""),
                                    base_location=file_folder,
                                    saved_sim_folder="demo_out")

    phi_xdmf, sigma_xdmf = setup_xdmf_files(["phi", "sigma"], data_folder)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-113

Finally, we define the parameters of the differential equation using a mocafe object created for this purpose,
Parameters. A Parameters object can be initialized in several ways. In the following, we define it from a
dictionary where each key is the parameter name and the value is the actual value of the parameter.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 113-132

.. code-block:: default

    parameters = from_dict({
        "phi0_in": 1.,  # adimentional
        "phi0_out": 0.,  # adimdimentional

        "s_max": 73.,
        "s_min": -73.
    })


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 133-143

Definition of the spatial domain and the function space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similarly to the original paper, we are going to simulate the model on a 2D square mesh of dimension
2000 x 2000 :math:`\mu m`. This is pretty simple to do using FEniCs, which provides the class ``RectangleMesh``
to do this job.

More precisely, in the following we are going to define a mesh of the dimension described above, with 512
points for each side.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-155

.. code-block:: default

    nx = 512
    ny = nx
    x_max = 1000  # um
    x_min = -1000  # um
    y_max = x_max
    y_min = x_min

    mesh = fenics.RectangleMesh(fenics.Point(x_min, y_min),
                                fenics.Point(x_max, y_max),
                                nx,
                                ny)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 156-169

From the mesh defined above, we can then define the ``FunctionSpace``, that is the set of the piece-wise
polynomial function to be used to represent our solution computed using the finite element method (FEM). Since
the model we wish to simulate is composed of two coupled equations, we need to define a MixedElement function
space with two different elements. In this implementation, we will use for both equations the same element
type, "CG" (Continuous Galerking), of the first order, which can be created in FEniCS simply using::

    cg1_element = fenics.FiniteElement("CG", fenics.triangle, 1)  # define element
    mixed_element = fenics.MixedElement([cg1_element] * 2)  # define mixed element
    function_space = fenics.FunctionSpace(mesh, mixed_element)  # define function space for the given mesh

However, the very same operation can be performed in just one line using the following method provided by
mocafe:


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 169-171

.. code-block:: default

    function_space = get_mixed_function_space(mesh, 2, "CG", 1)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 172-177

Initial conditions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since the system of differential equations involves time, we need to define initial conditions for both
:math:`\varphi` and :math`\sigma`. According to the original paper as initial condition for :math:`\varphi`
we will define an elliptical tumor with the given semiaxes:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 177-180

.. code-block:: default

    semiax_x = 100  # um
    semiax_y = 150  # um


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 181-200

With FEniCS we can do so by defining an expression which represent mathematically our initial condition:

.. code-block:: default

   phi0_max = 1
   phi0_min = 0
   # cpp code that returns True if the point x is inside the ellipse, and False otherwise
   is_in_ellipse_cpp_code = "((pow(x[0] / semiax_x, 2)) + (pow(x[1] / semiax_y, 2)) <= 1)"
   # cpp code that returns 1 if the above statement is True, and 0 otherwise
   phi0_cpp_code = is_in_ellipse_cpp_code + " ? phi0_max : phi0_min"
   # FEniCS expression, built from cpp code defined above
   phi0 = fenics.Expression(phi0_cpp_code,
                            degree=2,
                            semiax_x=semiax_x,
                            semiax_y=semiax_y,
                            phi0_max=phi0_max,
                            phi0_min=phi0_min)

However, if you don't feel confident in defining your own expression, you can use the one provided by mocafe:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 200-206

.. code-block:: default

    phi0 = EllipseField(center=np.array([0., 0.]),
                        semiax_x=semiax_x,
                        semiax_y=semiax_y,
                        inside_value=parameters.get_value("phi0_in"),
                        outside_value=parameters.get_value("phi0_out"))


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 207-210

The FEniCS expression must then be projected or interpolated in the function space in order to obtain a
fenics Function. Notice that since the function space we defined is mixed, we must choose one of the
sub-field to define the function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 210-213

.. code-block:: default

    phi0 = fenics.interpolate(phi0, function_space.sub(0).collapse())
    phi_xdmf.write(phi0, 0)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 214-219

Notice also that since the mixed function space is defined by two identical function spaces, it makes no
difference to pick sub(0) or sub(1).

After having defined the initial condition for :math:`\varphi`, let's define the initial for :math:`\sigma` in a
similar fashion:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 219-227

.. code-block:: default

    sigma0 = EllipseField(center=np.array([0., 0.]),
                          semiax_x=semiax_x,
                          semiax_y=semiax_y,
                          inside_value=parameters.get_value("sigma0_in"),
                          outside_value=parameters.get_value("sigma0_out"))
    sigma0 = fenics.interpolate(sigma0, function_space.sub(0).collapse())
    sigma_xdmf.write(sigma0, 0)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 228-235

PDE System definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After having defined the initial conditions for the system, we can proceed with the definition of the system
itself.

First of all, we define the two variables, ``phi`` and ``sigma``, for which the system will be solved:
define bidim function

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 235-239

.. code-block:: default

    u = fenics.Function(function_space)
    fenics.assign(u, [phi0, sigma0])
    phi, sigma = fenics.split(u)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 240-241

Then, we define the test functions for defining the weak forms of the PDEs:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 241-243

.. code-block:: default

    v1, v2 = fenics.TestFunctions(function_space)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 244-245

Now, let's define an expression for s

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 245-250

.. code-block:: default

    s_expression = PythonFunctionField(
        python_fun=lambda: parameters.get_value("s_average") + random.uniform(parameters.get_value("s_min"),
                                                                              parameters.get_value("s_max")),
    )


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 251-252

And the weak form of the system, which is already defined in mocafe

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 252-255

.. code-block:: default

    weak_form = pc_model.prostate_cancer_form(phi, phi0, sigma, v1, parameters) + \
        pc_model.prostate_cancer_nutrient_form(sigma, sigma0, phi, v2, s_expression, parameters)


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 256-260

Simulation
^^^^^^^^^^
Simulating this mathematical model is just a matter of solving the PDE system defined above for each time step.
To do so, we define a Problem and a Solver directly calling the PETSc backend.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 260-265

.. code-block:: default

    jacobian = fenics.derivative(weak_form, u)  # jacobian of the system

    problem = PETScProblem(jacobian, weak_form, [])
    solver = PETScSolver({"ksp_type": "gmres", "pc_type": "asm"}, mesh.mpi_comm())


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 266-267

Then we initialize a progress bar with tqdm

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 267-273

.. code-block:: default

    n_steps = 100
    if rank == 0:
        progress_bar = tqdm(total=n_steps, ncols=100)
    else:
        progress_bar = None


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 274-275

And finally we iterate in time and solve the system at each time step

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 275-295

.. code-block:: default

    t = 0
    for current_step in range(n_steps):
        # update time
        t += parameters.get_value("dt")

        # solve problem for current time
        solver.solve(problem, u.vector())

        # update values
        fenics.assign([phi0, sigma0], u)

        # save current solutions to file
        phi_xdmf.write(phi0, t)
        sigma_xdmf.write(sigma0, t)

        # update pbar
        if rank == 0:
            progress_bar.update(1)
