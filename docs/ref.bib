abstract = {Recently, mathematical modeling and simulation of diseases and their treatments have enabled the prediction of clinical outcomes and the design of optimal therapies on a personalized (i.e., patient-specific) basis. This new trend in medical research has been termed “predictive medicine.” Prostate cancer (PCa) is a ma- jor health problem and an ideal candidate to explore tissue-scale, personalized modeling of cancer growth for two main reasons: First, it is a small organ, and, second, tumor growth can be esti- mated by measuring serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA, a PCa biomarker in blood), which may enable in vivo validation. In this paper, we present a simple continuous model that reproduces the growth patterns of PCa. We use the phase-field method to account for the transformation of healthy cells to cancer cells and use diffusion−reaction equations to compute nutrient consumption and PSA production. To accurately and efficiently compute tumor growth, our simulations leverage isogeometric analysis (IGA). Our model is shown to reproduce a known shape instability from a spheroidal pattern to fingered growth. Results of our computa- tions indicate that such shift is a tumor response to escape starva- tion, hypoxia, and, eventually, necrosis. Thus, branching enables the tumor to minimize the distance from inner cells to external nutrients, contributing to cancer survival and further develop- ment. We have also used our model to perform tissue-scale, per- sonalized simulation of a PCa patient, based on prostatic anatomy extracted from computed tomography images. This simulation shows tumor progression similar to that seen in clinical practice.},

Prima lettura

In questo articolo presentano un modello phase field per lo sviluppo del tumore alla prostata. La domanda che accompagna l'articolo {\`{e}} quindi: quanto {\`{e}} accurato il modello?

Risposta: il modello {\`{e}} molto accurato sia in vitro che in vivo. {\`{e}} stato confrontato sia con un cancro in vitro sia con lo sviluppo di un tumore in vitro inserendo il modello matematico in un modello 3D di una prostata di un paziente reale, dimostrando uno sviluppo del cancro molto simile.},
